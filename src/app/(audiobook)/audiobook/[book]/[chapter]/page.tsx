            Five years ago marks the last time we experienced an era of the most advanced technology
            in human history. It was an era characterized by our ability to manipulate materials at
            the nano level, a capability we often referred to as "Magic".
          </p>
          <p>
            The term "Magic" may be misunderstood by future generations, similar to what happened in
            Zein's world where magic had already disappeared thousand years before my arrival.
            There, magic was portrayed as something mystical and irrational, devoid of any
            scientific basis.
          </p>
          <p>
            The narratives and tales that are handed down from one generation to the next tend to be
            the simplest and most easily understood ones. These stories, embedded in the fabric of
            our shared cultural memory, have a resilience that allows them to endure over time. On
            the other hand, practical and functional knowledge, while perhaps more immediately
            useful, tends to be more fragile, easily lost in the shifting sands of time. The same
            principle applies to the arcane and mysterious knowledge of magic. Despite its power and
            allure, without a concerted effort to preserve it, this knowledge will eventually fade
            from memory, forgotten by all.
          </p>
          <p>
            …
          </p>
          <p>
            Historians are primarily tasked with the recording of history, not scientific facts, and
            there are instances when society consciously alters the course of recorded history to
            serve the interests of future generations. This process, while seemingly beneficial, can
            lead to the degradation of historical information and create misleading narratives about
            our past.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the past, scientists meticulously encoded all their data with the hope that it might
            prove to be beneficial in the future. However, I harbor a certain degree of pessimism
            regarding the probability of a day arriving when this encoded data can be successfully
            decoded and utilized.
          </p>
          <p>
            Magic has always held an aura of mystery and enchantment, primarily due to the lack of
            understanding about how it functions. This is quite similar to how certain devices that
            we use in our daily lives today are perceived. While the majority of people are aware of
            what these devices are capable of achieving, they don't necessarily hold an interest in
            understanding the intricate details of how these results are accomplished.
          </p>
          <p>
            …
          </p>
          <p>
            Do I miss that era?
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps, a little bit…
          </p>
          <p>
            …
          </p>
          <p>
            During that time, we experienced an almost otherworldly era where fantastical buildings
            and machines were commonplace. Our wars were fought with such magical vehicles, armors
            and weapons imbued with mystical properties. The creatures that fought alongside us were
            not of this world, with some of them possessing abilities that would make the most
            hardened soldier tremble. This time period was truly a testament to the power of magic
            and the limitless possibilities it offered.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the early days of magic, preparing and casting spells was a complex and
            time-consuming task that demanded extensive knowledge, skill, and practice. However, the
            invention of "magic cards" and the development of type commands called "spells" made the
            process much simpler and more accessible to a broader audience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Magic cards, a form of magical technology, enable users to conveniently store and access
            a diverse range of spells and incantations. By selecting the appropriate card and
            reciting the corresponding spell command, users can effortlessly cast potent magic
            without the need for laborious manual preparation and casting of spells.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps the magic cards technology was the most memorable for me. Through it, I could
            use magic and meet someone lovely besides my brother. To this day, I remember her as my
            first hero. She gave me courage and kickstarted everything.
          </p>
          <p>
            …
          </p>
          <p>
            However, those days are long gone. Some people have moved on, while others still cling
            to the past. They struggle to accept the reality that we must return to a primitive
            world. Yet, ultimately, this is the only path available to us. It is the sole means by
            which I can save everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            …
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't care how they perceive me - whether as a savior or a destroyer of the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            I really don’t care…
          </p>
          <p>
            …
          </p>
          <p>
            If someday I were to sit down and recount this story to my son, he might look at me with
            wide, disbelieving eyes, dismissing it as nothing more than a fanciful fairy tale spun
            by his imaginative mother. In our present day, technologies once revered and considered
            as magic have sadly been reduced to nothing more than simple stones and statues, devoid
            of their original significance. It seems as if there is no reason to keep these relics
            around, considering them as nothing more than trash from a bygone era. However, there
            are some among us who view them differently, preserving these vestiges of the past as
            valuable monuments, reminders of our history.
          </p>

            My son, who will soon be celebrating his fourth birthday, is the most precious thing in
            my world. He's a bundle of energy and curiosity, yet he's not quite old enough to
            comprehend the intricacies of this story. However, I am penning down these words,
            weaving this narrative so that one day, when he's older and capable of understanding, he
            can read it. And hopefully, after he has turned the last page, he will look at me, his
            mother, with newfound appreciation for her awesomeness and brilliance, and maybe, he'd
            even share a laugh with me. (Hopefully, haha!)
          </p>

            This is not a tale about an omnipotent being, an overpowered individual who can tackle
            every obstacle single-handedly. I am far from being such a character. You may have come
            across narratives of heroic figures in the past, mine included, but have you ever given
            thought to the numerous other individuals who fought fiercely alongside them? A
            multitude of names have been overlooked, omitted from the historical records and
            deprived of the recognition they deserved. These unsung heroes staked their very lives
            on a cause, the outcome of which was a mystery even to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The label of a 'savior' is a burden as much as it is an honor, a double-edged sword that
            cuts as deeply as being branded a 'devastator'. It feels as though I am usurping the
            credit, the honor that rightly belongs to all those brave souls who laid down their
            lives in service of a cause greater than themselves, and for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            …
          </p>
          <p>
            Who am I compared to them?
          </p>
          <p>
            …

            My name is Fienna. In terms of my biological age, I am 33 years old. However, when it
            comes to calculating my age from the actual date of my birth, things become a bit more
            complicated. To be honest, I don't really have an exact number. Life has been a
            whirlwind and events have unfolded at such a rapid pace that it's been difficult to keep
            track of time. From my perspective, it feels like everything has happened much too
            quickly. So, if you were to ask me how old I truly am, taking into account all my
            experiences and the passage of time from my unique perspective, I'd have to say it's
            significantly higher than my biological age.

            Now, I work as a self-employed writer, a job that I created for myself just a few
            minutes ago. Yes, I am currently living a super peaceful and relaxed life. I cannot even
            find anything to make me feel busy anymore. In the last five years, my main
            responsibility was just raising my child and witnessing my husband's second marriage.
            Occasionally, I take a walk to the research institute with my adorable little boy, a
            place where many teachers once expected me to be.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's not that I no longer care about this world. It's just that my husband has been
            repeatedly reminding me to stop pushing myself. "You have done enough for us, let me
            handle the rest," he said. We have been together for quite a long time before our
            marriage, so he has witnessed my efforts firsthand. It may seem strange to obey someone
            younger than me, but it's my husband, and I actually feel very grateful when he says
            that.

            I will walk you through my memory,

            step by step,
